# CSS-To-The-Rescue
I will be making a an atomic explosion...

## Week 1
In the first week we were able to choose our theme's. I had many idea's for 3 of the themes, but then I came up with the idea of creating a nuclear explosion in CSS with the fireworks theme. After I got approval of Sanne to do it, I started thinking about what I am gonna create.

### First thoughts
So obviously I need SOME sort of particle emmitter style setup to create this. I can't literally make a particle emitter which is randomized, but I should be able to make something that LOOKS randomized. Since you can infinitely loop animations in CSS, I can contiously 'spawn' elements. So I definitely have to think about that. I also want the user to be able to slightly customize the explosion by being able to choose to add a shockwave, radiation cloud and initial flash. I specifically want the user to be able to turn that off or on because if anyone with epilepsy stumbles across this project, I don't think they'd appreciate the bright lights... 

I initially wanted to add a sound for when the shockwave reaches you, but I'm not sure if it's possible? But as I'm writing this I thought of an idea: is it possible to create an audio tag which when you press the button starts the audio. The audio however is around 30 seconds of silence but at the end has a shockwave sound. In my head this sorta makes sense but I'd have to test this out. In any case, you are also able to select the distance and depending on where you are, the shockwave will reach you faster or slower. If I have extra time I might want to add a close-up slowmotion option which would show the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9S3MUxH680">rope trick effect</a>. Honestly I think it looks insane and would love to recreate this in CSS, but I think this could even be a project of it's own so for now it's in the backburner...

I also want to add atomic goggles which you HAVE to wear because it will render you blind otherwise. As a safety, if you have flashing lights turned off, you won't be able to press the button at all. If you have flashing lights turn on you will be able to press the button to which you will only see a bright flash. Now that I'm typing this I am doubting how I am supposed to do this system without JavaScript, but I'll have to think about that or think of something else.

### Features and sketch
The features I want to add are:
- Light / Dark mode (daytime or nighttime)
- Shockwave / radiation cloud / initial flash toggle
- Distance selector
- Atomic goggles
- Choose color of nuke? Maybe a fun option to add

Above is my first sketch I made and I tried to explain which part should be what element. I might have to change the button for an audio tag instead. Or atleast let the audio tag play somehow if it's checked? I need to know if this is possible!
